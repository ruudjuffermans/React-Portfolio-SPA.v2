      <p>
        I'm a data engineer based in Amsterdam. My journey into the
        world of data began during my years in college, where I was fascinated
        by distributed systems, data stream, and blockchain programming. Also the power of data in making informed decisions and predictions really fascinated me. This
        fascination led me to dive deep into data engineering, where I could
        channel my analytical skills and curiosity to build scalable and
        efficient data pipelines. My commitment to learning and adapting to new
        technologies has been the cornerstone of my progress in this field. The
        thrill of extracting insights from complex data sets and the impact of
        these insights on business strategies keep me motivated and driven. Ialso like to work on my own projects, these not only fuel my passion but also sharpen my skills, enabling
        me to bring innovative solutions to the challenges I face
        professionally.
